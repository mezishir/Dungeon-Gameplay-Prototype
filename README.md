# Dungeon-Gameplay-Prototype
This project was built as part of a structured Unreal Engine C++ curriculum to explore interaction systems, lighting, and first-person gameplay mechanics. I focused on implementing object pickup, trigger-based events, and player targeting while debugging and extending base systems provided by the engine.
